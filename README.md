# Cloud Cyber Range

This repository documents the design and execution of a full-spectrum,
Azure-based cyber range built to simulate real-world attack paths,
detection engineering workflows, and incident response operations.

The environment mirrors modern enterprise infrastructure with a focus on:
- Identity-centric threats
- Cloud control-plane abuse
- Detection and response engineering
- MITRE ATT&CK–aligned adversary emulation

## What This Demonstrates
- Security engineering mindset
- Red, blue, and purple team workflows
- Cloud-native detection design
- Incident response readiness
- Executive-level security communication

## Ethical & Safety Statement
All activity documented here was performed in a fully isolated Azure
environment using intentionally vulnerable systems. No malware was
developed, no production systems were targeted, and all scenarios are
defensive and simulation-based.

## Repository Structure
Each directory represents a core security discipline:
- `architecture/` – Lab and network design
- `threat-modeling/` – Attack surface and risk analysis
- `red-team/` – Adversary emulation scenarios
- `blue-team/` – Detection engineering artifacts
- `purple-team/` – Detection gap analysis
- `incident-response/` – Response playbooks
- `cloud-security/` – Azure-specific risks
- `governance/` – Resilience and compliance
- `executive/` – Business-level reporting
- `career/` – Resume-ready artifacts
